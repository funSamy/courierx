   - Better error handling and validation

### ðŸ”„ Migration Required

#### Before Deployment

1. Create S3 bucket for Terraform state
2. Create DynamoDB table for state locking
3. Set up AWS OIDC provider and IAM role
4. Update GitHub repository secrets

#### Files Changed

- `terraform/backend.tf` - NEW: Remote state configuration
- `terraform/main.tf` - REFACTORED: Security groups, EIP, cloud-init
- `terraform/variables.tf` - UPDATED: Removed Route 53, added SSH key
- `terraform/outputs.tf` - REFACTORED: DNS instructions output
- `terraform/user_data.sh` - NEW: Comprehensive setup script
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - SIMPLIFIED: Single job, OIDC auth

#### Files Deprecated

- `scripts/configure_mail_server.sh` - Logic moved to user_data.sh
- `scripts/setup_postfix.sh` - Logic moved to user_data.sh
- `scripts/setup_dkim.sh` - Logic moved to user_data.sh
- `scripts/setup_fowarding.sh` - Logic moved to user_data.sh

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Problems)

```code
GitHub Actions â†’ Terraform â†’ EC2 Instance
                     â†“
              SSH Provisioner â†’ Manual Config
                     â†“
              Route 53 DNS Records
```

**Issues:**

- Fragile SSH-based post-provisioning
- Local state file (risk of loss)
- Hard dependency on Route 53
- Two-job deployment complexity
- Long-lived AWS credentials in GitHub

### After (Improved)

```code
GitHub Actions â†’ Terraform â†’ EC2 Instance + Cloud-Init
      â†“                             â†“
   OIDC Auth              Self-Configuring Setup
      â†“                             â†“
   S3 State               Manual DNS at Hostinger
```

**Benefits:**

- Robust cloud-init automation
- Remote state with locking
- External DNS provider flexibility
- Single-job deployment
- Secure OIDC authentication

## Cost Impact

### Free Tier Usage

- **EC2 t3.small**: 750 hours/month (24/7 coverage)
- **Elastic IP**: Free when attached to running instance
- **S3**: 5GB storage (sufficient for Terraform state)
- **DynamoDB**: 25GB storage, 25 WCU/RCU (overkill for state locking)

### Cost Savings

- **Route 53 Elimination**: Save ~$0.50/month per hosted zone
- **No Data Transfer Charges**: 100GB/month free tier covers email usage

## Security Enhancements

1. **Network Security**
   - Custom security group (vs default)
   - Minimal port exposure (22, 25, 587, 993)
   - UFW firewall on instance

2. **Authentication**
   - OIDC vs long-lived IAM keys
   - Fail2ban for intrusion prevention
   - SSH key pair management

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Encrypted Terraform state
   - State locking prevents conflicts
   - Immutable infrastructure with cloud-init

## Deployment Workflow

### Old Process

1. Run GitHub Action (provision job)
2. Wait for infrastructure
3. Run GitHub Action (configure job)
4. SSH-based configuration
5. Manual Route 53 verification

### New Process

1. Run GitHub Action (single job)
2. Wait for cloud-init completion (5-10 min)
3. Configure DNS at Hostinger
4. Retrieve DKIM key via SSH
5. Validate email functionality

## Recovery and Troubleshooting

### State Recovery

- State stored in S3 with versioning
- DynamoDB prevents concurrent modifications
- Easy team collaboration

### Debugging

- Cloud-init logs: `/var/log/courierx-setup.log`
- Setup summary: `/root/courierx-setup-summary.txt`
- Real-time monitoring during setup

### Rollback Strategy

- Terraform state history in S3
- Immutable infrastructure allows clean rebuilds
- Clear DNS configuration documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Pre-Deployment Setup**
   - Create AWS resources (S3, DynamoDB, OIDC)
   - Update Terraform backend configuration
   - Configure GitHub secrets

2. **Migration Testing**
   - Test deployment in staging environment
   - Validate DNS configuration process
   - Verify email functionality

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy with new architecture
   - Configure DNS records
   - Monitor setup completion
   - Test email sending/receiving

4. **Post-Deployment**
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Consider Let's Encrypt SSL automation
   - Document operational procedures

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy

- Terraform state versioning in S3
- Configuration files stored in Git
- DKIM keys backed up during setup

### Monitoring

- AWS billing alerts
- Service health checks
- Email deliverability monitoring

### Disaster Recovery

- Infrastructure as Code enables quick rebuilds
- Clear documentation for manual steps
- Automated setup reduces human error

This migration significantly improves the reliability, security, and maintainability of your CourierX mail server while staying within AWS Free Tier limits.
