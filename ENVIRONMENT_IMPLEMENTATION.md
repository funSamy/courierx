# Environment Support Implementation Summary

## âœ… What We've Implemented

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration Files

- **`terraform/staging.tfvars`**: Staging environment configuration
- **`terraform/prod.tfvars`**: Production environment configuration
- Both files contain environment-specific tags and settings
- Secrets remain in GitHub repository secrets (secure)

### 2. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow

- **Choice input**: Dropdown to select `staging` or `prod`
- **Validation step**: Checks if selected `.tfvars` file exists
- **Dynamic configuration**: Uses `-var-file=<environment>.tfvars`
- **Environment visibility**: Shows which environment is being deployed

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

- **`ENVIRONMENTS.md`**: Complete guide for environment configuration
- **Updated README.md**: Reflects new environment selection process
- **Clear instructions**: How to deploy to different environments

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Deployment Process

1. **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection
2. **Validation**: Automatically checks configuration file exists
3. **Configuration**: Loads appropriate `.tfvars` file
4. **Deployment**: Applies environment-specific settings
5. **Tagging**: Resources tagged with correct environment labels

### Environment Selection

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    environment:
      description: 'Environment to deploy to'
      required: true
      type: choice
      options:
      - staging
      - prod
      default: 'staging'
```

### Variable File Usage

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve \
  -var-file="${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}.tfvars" \
  -var="domain_name=${{ secrets.DOMAIN_NAME }}" \
  # ... other secret variables
```

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Structure

### Staging Environment (`staging.tfvars`)

```hcl
tags = {
  Project     = "CourierX"
  Environment = "Staging"
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  Purpose     = "Mail Server"
}
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

### Production Environment (`prod.tfvars`)

```hcl
tags = {
  Project     = "CourierX"
  Environment = "Production"
  ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  Purpose     = "Mail Server"
  Backup      = "Required"
}
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits

### 1. Clean Separation

- Environment-specific configurations in dedicated files
- Clear visual distinction in AWS console through tags
- Separate deployment logs and tracking

### 2. Free Tier Compatible

- Uses GitHub's free `workflow_dispatch` feature
- No paid "Environments" feature required
- Choice input provides clean UI without cost

### 3. Flexible and Extensible

- Easy to add new environments (just create new `.tfvars`)
- Can override any Terraform variable per environment
- Supports different domains, instance types, etc.

### 4. Security Maintained

- Secrets remain in GitHub repository secrets
- No sensitive data in `.tfvars` files
- Consistent OIDC authentication

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Deploy to Staging

1. Go to Actions â†’ "Deploy CourierX Mail Server"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select "staging" from dropdown
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Deploy to Production

1. Go to Actions â†’ "Deploy CourierX Mail Server"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select "prod" from dropdown
4. Click "Run workflow"

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Users

1. **Test the new workflow**:
   - Try deploying to staging first
   - Verify environment tags appear correctly
   - Confirm DNS configuration works

2. **Customize environments**:
   - Modify `.tfvars` files for your needs
   - Add environment-specific variables
   - Consider subdomain approach if needed

3. **Operational workflow**:
   - Use staging for testing changes
   - Deploy to production after validation
   - Destroy staging to save Free Tier hours

## ðŸ”„ Migration from Old Approach

The old workflow had a simple environment input but didn't use environment-specific configuration files. The new approach:

- **Before**: Single configuration for all environments
- **After**: Dedicated `.tfvars` files with environment-specific settings
- **Benefit**: Clear separation and easier management

Users don't need to change their GitHub secrets - the same secrets work for both environments. Only the Terraform configuration (tags, instance settings) differs between environments.

This implementation provides a professional, scalable approach to environment management while staying within GitHub's free tier limitations.
